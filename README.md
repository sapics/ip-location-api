# ip-location-api [![npm version](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/ip-location-api?color=success&style=flat-square&label=npm)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ip-location-api)

Fast and customizable nodejs api to get geolocation information from ip address.
`ip-location-api` make a fast lookup by using in-memory database.

This api is created for server-side javascript like Node.js.
If you need client-side javascript which works in **BROWSER**, please try to use [@iplookup/country](https://github.com/sapics/ip-location-api/tree/main/browser/country) or [@iplookup/geocode](https://github.com/sapics/ip-location-api/tree/main/browser/geocode).


## Synopsis

```javascript
import { lookup } from 'ip-location-api'
// or CJS format
// const { lookup } = require('ip-location-api')

var ip = "207.97.227.239"
var location = lookup(ip)
// If you use Asynchronouns version which is configured with smallMemory=true,
// var location = await lookup(ip)

console.log(location)
{
  country: 'FR',
  region1: 'NOR',
  region1_name: 'Normandy',
  region2: '27', 
  region2_name: 'Eure',
  city: 'Heudicourt',
  // metro: Defined only in US (Aug.2024)
  timezone: 'Europe/Paris',
  eu: 1,
  latitude: 49.3335,
  longitude: 1.6566,
  area: 5,
  postcode: 27860,
  country_name: 'France',
  country_native: 'France',
  phone: [ 33 ],
  continent: 'EU',
  capital: 'Paris',

}
```

## Benchmark

I make a benchmark for making comparison with intel 12700 (2.1GHz), SSD, nodejs v20.
You can change the memory usage or lookup time, by customizing location information.

| benchmark | type | in-memory db | startup | lookup ipv4 | lookup ipv6 |
| ---- | ---- | ---- |  ---- | ---- | ---- |
| ip-location-api<br>(default) | country | 6.9 MB  | 3 ms  | 0.362 μs/ip | 0.708 μs/ip |
| ip-location-api<br>(async)   | country | 2.9 MB  | 2 ms  | 243 μs/ip   | 255 μs/ip   |

## Installation

```bash
$ npm i ip-location-api
```


## API

ip-location-api has two modes which are synchronous and asynchronous.
Synchronouns one load all data in-memory at startup time, thus it makes fast lookup.
Asynchronouns one load smaller data in-memory at startup time, and the other data is loaded from the hard drive for each lookup.

| type | memory usage | startup | lookup |
| ---- | ---- | ---- |  ---- |
| Synchronouns  | Large | Slow | Fast |
| Asynchronouns | Small | Fast | Slow |

If you have a enough memory, I recommend to use synchronouns one because lookup is over 300 times faster than asynchronouns one.


## Field description

Note that as far as possible, the same field names as in `geoip-lite` are used, but some different field names are used.

## Setup the configuration

You can configure the api by 3 way.
- CLI parameters: `ILA_FIELDS=latitude,longitude`
- Environment variables: `ILA_FIELDS=latitude,longitude`
- Javascript: `await reload({fields: 'latitude,longitude'})` .

The name of CLI prameter and environment variables are same.


Conf key in `reload(conf)` is named with "LOWER CAMEL", CLI or ENV parameter is named with "SNAKE" with adding "ILA_" (come from Ip-Location-Api).

| `reload(conf)` | CLI or ENV | default | description |
| ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- |
| fields | ILA_FIELDS | country | You can change the fields to be retrived from [MaxMind](https://www.maxmind.com/). When you set "all", all fields are displayed. |
| addCountryInfo | ILA_ADD_COUNTRY_INFO | false | "true" make to add the country information from [Countries](https://github.com/annexare/Countries). This needs "country" field. |
| dataDir | ILA_DATA_DIR | ../data | Directory for database file |
| tmpDataDir | ILA_TMP_DATA_DIR | ../tmp | Directory for temporary file |
| apiDir | ILA_API_DIR | .. | Directory for ip-location-api |
| smallMemory | ILA_SMALL_MEMORY | false | false: synchronouns, true: asynchronouns |
| smallMemoryFileSize | ILA_SMALL_MEMORY_FILE_SIZE | 4096 | Max file size for asynchronouns data (no change is recommended) |
| licenseKey | ILA_LICENSE_KEY | redist | By setting [MaxMind](https://www.maxmind.com/) License key, you can download latest version of database from [MaxMind](https://www.maxmind.com/) server. By setting to "redist", you can download the database from [node-geolite2-redist](https://github.com/sapics/node-geolite2-redist) repository which re-distribute the GeoLite2 database. |
| ipLocationDb | ILA_IP_LOCATION_DB | | When you need only "country" field, you can use [ip-location-db](https://github.com/sapics/ip-location-db) data |
| downloadType | ILA_DOWNLOAD_TYPE | reuse | By setting to "false", "tmpDataDir" directory is deleted every update. "reuse" dose not delete "tmpDataDir" and re-use "tmpDataDir"'s database if the database file dose not update. |
| autoUpdate | ILA_AUTO_UPDATE | default | By setting to "false", it dose not update automatically. "default" updates twice weekly. You can set CRON PATTERN FORMAT which is provided by [cron](https://github.com/kelektiv/node-cron) with UTC timezone (For example, ILA_AUTO_UPDATE="0 1 * * *" for daily update). |
| multiDbDir | ILA_MULTI_DB_DIR | false | If you use multiple "dataDir", please make this value to "true" |
| series | ILA_SERIES | GeoLite2 | By setting to "GeoIP2", you can use premium database "GeoIP2" |
| language | ILA_LANGUAGE | en | You can choose "de", "en", "es", "fr", "ja", "pt-BR", "ru", "zh-CN". By changing, the language of "region1_name", "region2_name", "city" fields are changed |
| silent | ILA_SILENT | false | true: deactivate unnecessary console.log |


## Update database

```bash
npm run updatedb
```

or

```javascript
import { updateDb } from 'ip-location-api'
await updateDb(setting)
```


There are three database update way.
- ILA_LICENSE_KEY=redist
- ILA_LICENSE_KEY=YOUR_GEOLITE2_LICENSE_KEY
- ILA_IP_LOCATION_DB=YOUR_CHOOSEN_DATABSE

When you set "ILA_LICENSE_KEY=redist" which is the dafault setting, it downloads GeoLite2 database from the redistribution repository [node-geolite2-redist](https://github.com/sapics/node-geolite2-redist).

When you set "ILA_LICENSE_KEY=YOUR_GEOLITE2_LICENSE_KEY", it downloads GeoLite2 dastabase from the MaxMind provided server.
`YOUR_GEOLITE2_LICENSE_KEY` should be replaced by a valid GeoLite2 license key. Please [follow instructions](https://dev.maxmind.com/geoip/geoip2/geolite2/) provided by MaxMind to obtain a license key.

When you set "ILA_IP_LOCATION_DB=YOUR_CHOOSEN_DATABSE", it downloads from the [ip-location-db](https://github.com/sapics/ip-location-db) (country type only).
You can "YOUR_CHOOSEN_DATABSE" from [ip-location-db](https://github.com/sapics/ip-location-db) with country type. For example, "geolite2-geo-whois-asn" is wider IP range country database which is equivalent to GeoLite2 database result for GeoLite2 country covered IP range and geo-whois-asn-country for the other IP range. 
The other example, "geo-whois-asn" is [CC0 licensed database](https://github.com/sapics/ip-location-db/tree/main/geo-asn-country), if you are unable to apply the GeoLite2 License.


After v2.0, the database is created automatically at initial startup, and updated automatically by setting `ILA_AUTO_UPDATE` which updates twice weekly with default setting.


## How to use with an example

When you need only geographic coordinates, please set "ILA_FIELDS=latitude,longitude".
You need to create a database for each configuration.
After v2.0.0, the database is created at initial running (which takes some seconds), and auto update with `ILA_AUTO_UPDATE` which update twice weekly with default setting.

The database is created by following CLI

```bash
$ npm run updatedb ILA_FIELDS=latitude,longitude
```

or

```bash
$ ILA_FIELDS=latitude,longitude # set environment variable
$ npm run updatedb
```

or you can create database with 'create.js' which includes the following.

```javascript
await updateDb({fields:['latitude', 'longitude']})
```


The CLI command for using `app.js` which uses `ip-location-api` is necessary to start with following CLI parameter

```bash
$ node app.js ILA_FIELDS=latitude,longitude
```

or environment variable

```bash
$ ILA_FIELDS=latitude,longitude # set environment variable
$ node app.js
```

or you can write down configuration in `reload` function of app.js as

```javascript
await reload({fields:['latitude', 'longitude']})
// or await reload({fields:'latitude,longitude'})
```


If you need all the data in above field table, setting "ILA_FIELDS=all" and "ILA_ADD_COUNTRY_INFO=true" is the one.


| benchmark | in-memory db | startup | lookup ipv4 | lookup ipv6 |
| ---- | ---- | ---- |  ---- | ---- |
| longitude,latitude | 46.5 MB  | 10 ms  | 0.428 μs/ip | 0.776 μs/ip |
| all                | 76.4 MB  | 18 ms  | 1.054 μs/ip | 1.348 μs/ip |


## For module bundler (webpack, vite, next.js, etc)

Some module bundlers cannot work with original database system.
If module bundlers could not work with `ip-location-api`, please try to import module as following.
It works almost same as original module.

```js
import { lookup } from 'ip-location-api/pack'
```


It would be better to set directories for database files which have write permission.
Without write permission directories, you cannot use this module.

```bash
ILA_DATA_DIR=/your_database_directory
ILA_TMP_DATA_DIR=/your_tmporary_directory_for_database
```
